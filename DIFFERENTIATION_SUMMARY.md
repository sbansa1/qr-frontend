## 🎨 Visual Design Philosophy

### Color System (Modern SaaS)
```
Primary:  #6366F1 (Indigo)   - Professional, trustworthy
Accent:   #F59E0B (Amber)    - Energetic, creative
Success:  #10B981 (Emerald)  - Growth, conversion
Danger:   #EF4444 (Red)      - Warnings

vs Linktree's bright green (#43E55E) - too casual
