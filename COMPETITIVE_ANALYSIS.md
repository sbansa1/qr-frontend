- **Us = Modern SaaS aesthetic** (think Notion, Figma, Webflow)

#### 3. **Visual Hierarchy**
```
Our 3-Panel Layout:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Logo] QR Microsite Editor    [Save] [Publish] │

│ Blocks │  Live Preview    │   Inspector         │
│ Palette│  (Phone Frame)   │   (Properties)      │
│        │                  │                     │

Danger: #EF4444 (Red 500) - Warnings, limits

/* vs Linktree's Green (#43E55E) - Too casual */

## 🏁 CONCLUSION

### Our Competitive Edge:
We're **NOT trying to replace Linktree OR Openscreen**.  
We're creating the **middle ground that doesn't exist**:

- **Simpler than Openscreen** (for small businesses who need QR + landing pages)
- **More powerful than Linktree** (for users who need customization + analytics)
- **Built for physical + digital** (QR codes bridge both worlds)

### Unique Market Position:
**"The QR-first page builder for businesses that sell in the real world"**

Our customers are NOT Instagram influencers (Linktree's market).  
Our customers are NOT enterprise marketing teams (Openscreen's market).  
Our customers are **small businesses with physical touchpoints** (products, stores, events).

**Next Step:** Should I start implementing the Phase 2 features (themes, blocks) or focus on the QR customization features first?
